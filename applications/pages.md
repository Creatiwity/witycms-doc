# Pages

This is the essential application of wityCMS. If you want to make a website with a lot of pages, the application ***Pages*** is the solution. Each page created in this application is a full web page.

## Pages listing

The list contains all the pages created on your website. It gives you a rapid view of:

* Title
* Author
* Views
* Date of the last modification

* **Title***: Start by indicating the title of your page (less is better).

* **Content**: Thanks to **[CKEditor](http://docs.ckeditor.com/)** you are able to write, layout your news and add some pictures and videos as desired.

### Details

On the side, you find the details information about your current page:

* **Author**: by default the author is the name of the account with which you are log in. Moreover, you can change the author.
* **Subtitle**: used for *SEO*.
* **Image**: You can upload a main image for your page (use like header / page preview etc., that depends of your template).

### SEO

The "Title" and "Description" meta tags are **`html`** tags inserted in the `<head>` section of a web page (before the `<body>`).

They help you to provide information for the search engines, social networks and other systems using "*metadata*". The information on those tags are not visible on your website, but it appears in the source code of the page.

* **Meta title**: by default it is the page title
* **Meta description**: Input a short description of your page (optional). 125 characters maximum

### Post your page

To finalize the edition of your page, click on the **Submit** button.
