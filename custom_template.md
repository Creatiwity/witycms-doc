# Overriding application template

For each application page you want to customize you need to create a new file with this specification : 

By default each app has a theme but if you want to overwrite, you need to create your new .html file who define your news guideline.

To find out how name your .html file select the app file (e.g: News) located in .../app/news/front/templates/"listing.html".

Once you know how to name the file (e.g: News -> listing.html), you can create a new file


1. "template_name"
2. "templates"
3. "news"
4. Create your file **listing.html**
