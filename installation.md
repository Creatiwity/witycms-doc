*Prefix tables* field allows you to define the prefix added at the beginning of the name of the tables. We advise you to let the value "**wity**" (nb: an underscore character will be automatically added after the prefix). This prefix allows you to separate the wityCMS tables from other tables that you might use in the same database.
