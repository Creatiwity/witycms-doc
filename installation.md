## Web Server configuration

Apache server with *PHP5.3+*, mod_rewrite enabled and *.htaccess* files allowed.

## Database install

Depending on your host, you will need to create a blank database or be sure to create one. You can use a program like "*phpMyAdmin*" or the admin panel of your account.

Some hosts only allow you a single database. You must then use this database (to connect it use your nickname and your password). Be sure to use a prefix for tables that separate the wityCMS tables from other tables that you might use in the same database.

A database is a collection of data organized and required for the operation of an application.

When the application needs to use its database, it then queries the database manager (such as: *MySQL*, *MariaDB*) which will perform helpful actions in the database (add, modify or delete data, etc.). This program is optimized to effectively large volumes of data.

You will use *phpMyAdmin* to create and set up wityCMS's database.
Open another tab and enter the "local" address: http: // ... / phpMyAdmin
