# Quick start

Once you have installed wityCMS you can change some of the default settings assigned. To change those settings, you will have to edit certain configuration files.

## How to find configuration files

All configuration files are stored in wityCMS /system folder, but if you need to change specific parts of wityCMS, continue reading for some common examples.

## URL 

By default, the installer will try to detect if you have *Apache* and "*mod_rewrite enabled*". It will then create the "*.htaccess*" file for you. However, in some cases mainly due to server restrictions, wityCMS might not be able to do it, and you'll need to create the "*.htaccess*" file manually.

## Language

WityCMS supports multilingual mode, meaning that you can use and edit  wityCMS in several languages. To change the language, change the field during the installation of wityCMS. It will set the default language. You can add as many languages as you want for your content.

However, the system translation, there are two lang available :

* **English (en_GB)**
* **French (en_US)**

If you want to add a new translation, thank you submit a translation request; make sure the folder name for the new translation follows ISO 639 / ISO 3166 (http://www.localeplanet.com/icu/).
