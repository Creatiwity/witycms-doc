# News

To differentiate the two application "**News**" to "**Pages**", let's just say that application news has only one CMS page with multiple news after each other (like a blog).

"**News**" offers a dynamic side that does not have the "**Pages**". Moreover, the information is not sustainable on the screen, a new item is automatically placed above the last, shifting the presentation of your page. "**News**" are slightly more complex hierarchy that pages.

"**News**" follows the rules of publication: date of publication, text modification etc.

Using news application is interesting to create and manage your site's news, key announcements. If you think you create an RSS feed, these are the items that will be used. Interesting for those who want to subscribe to the latest news from your website ...
