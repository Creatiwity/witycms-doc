# News

To differentiate the two application "**News**" to "**Pages**", let's just say that application news has only one CMS page with multiple news after each other (like a blog).

"**News**" offers a dynamic side that does not have the "**Pages**". Moreover, the information is not sustainable on the screen, a new item is automatically placed above the last, shifting the presentation of your page. "**News**" are slightly more complex hierarchy that pages.

"**News**" appluclation follows the rules of publication: date of publication, text modification etc.

Using "**News**" application is interesting to create and manage your site's news, key announcements etc. If you think you create an "*RSS feed*", these is the application that will be used. Interesting for those who want to subscribe to the latest news from your website for example. 

"**News**" application will allows you to add single news to your website from the back-end to front-end with an advanced text editor ([CKEditor](http://docs.ckeditor.com/)).
