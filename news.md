# News

To differentiate the two application "**News**" to "**Pages**", let's just say that application news has only one CMS page with multiple news after each other (like a blog).

"**News**" offers a dynamic side that does not have the "**Pages**". Moreover, the information is not sustainable on the screen, a new item is automatically placed above the last, shifting the presentation of your page. "**News**" are slightly more complex hierarchy that pages.

"**News**" appliclation follows the rules of publication: date of publication, text modification etc.
