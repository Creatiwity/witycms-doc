# News

To distinguish between the application "**News**" and "**Pages**", you can notice that the application news has only one CMS page with multiple news after each other (like a blog).

"**News**" application offers a dynamic side that does not have the "**Pages**". Moreover, the information is not sustainable on the screen, another news can be placed above the last one, changing the information order of your page. "**News**" are slightly more complex hierarchically that "**Pages**".
