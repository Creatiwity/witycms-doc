# Slideshow

The Slideshow application will allow you to manage the slider on your website:

## Slides lists

This list contains all created slides and gives you their title as it appears on your website, the legend, the associated image, position, date of creation, and an action button allows you to change or delete its contents (according to permissions granted by your administrator).
In the top left of this list, a tab prompts you to create a new page. Click on "Add a slide".
