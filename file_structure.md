# File Structure

wityCMS has a fairly loose file structure — you can have as many files and folders as you want in your theme, as long as a few required theme files are present.

## Required theme files
If you don’t have these files, your theme won’t work properly, or just won’t show up at all. It’s vital you have these files.

* **admin-bootstrap**:
* **grafx**:
* **index.html**:
* **system**:
